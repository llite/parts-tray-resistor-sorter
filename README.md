# parts tray resistor sorter

Basic tray for sorting resistors inside a parts drawer. Has a rounded edge for easier removal of resistors. 


A label maker or packing tape and printed numbers works great for the labels. 

*Make sure to check the dimensions of your drawer as there are different sizes, in addition check the length of the resistors.*
